                                      PatternValue can hold a string, number, or boolean for exact matching.
                                      PatternValue represents a Quamina pattern value.
                                      It can be a plain value (string, number, boolean) for exact match,
                                      or an object with pattern operators like prefix, suffix, wildcard, etc.
                                      Examples:
                                        - "value" (exact match string)
                                        - 123 (exact match number)
                                        - true (exact match boolean)
