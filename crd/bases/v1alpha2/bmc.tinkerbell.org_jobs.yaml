                  Operations represents a list of baseboard management actions to be executed.
                  The operations are executed sequentially. Controller waits for one operation to complete before executing the next.
                  If a single operation fails, job execution stops and sets condition Failed.
                  Condition Completed is set only if all the operations were successful.
