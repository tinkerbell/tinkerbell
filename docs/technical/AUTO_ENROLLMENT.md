# Auto Enrollment in Tinkerbell

This document explains how Tinkerbell's auto enrollment feature works, how to enable it, how to configure a `ruleset.workflow.tinkerbell.org`, and how to discover Agent attributes.

## Overview

Auto enrollment automatically creates a Workflow for Tink Agents without having the need for a pre-existing Hardware object. This is accomplished by matching Agent attributes against a set of rules defined in a `ruleset.workflow.tinkerbell.org`. This allows for dynamic creation of Workflows based on Agent characteristics, such as its serial number, MAC address, and other hardware details.

## How Auto Enrollment works

When an Agent connects to the Tink Server:

1. The Agent sends its attributes (serial numbers, MAC addresses, etc.) to the Tink server.
1. Check if there is a Hardware object with the `spec.agentID` that matches the Agent ID.
1. If no workflow exists for the Agent, and auto enrollment is enabled and no Hardware object exists or `Hardware.spec.auto.enrollmentEnabled=true`, Tink server:
   1. Iterates through all RuleSets and checks for a rule that matches the Agent's attributes.
   1. Creates a Workflow for the Agent based on the matched RuleSet.
1. Tink Server serves the first Workflow Action to the Agent.
1. The Agent executes the Workflow Actions.

> [!NOTE]  
> As Auto Enrollment requires the Tink Agent to connect to the Tink Server and the expectation is that no Hardware object exists, it is generally required that the `--dhcp-mode` CLI flag or the `TINKERBELL_DHCP_MODE` environment variable be set to `auto-proxy`.
> `auto-proxy` mode will get a Machine into HookOS and running the Tink Agent without needing a pre-existing Hardware object. See the [DHCP Boot Modes documentation](./DHCP_BOOT_MODES.md) for more details on the `auto-proxy` mode.

> [!Note]
> To create a Workflow object in Kubernetes using the Agent ID, we must follow the Kubernetes naming conventions. This means that the Workflow object name might be modified to fit the requirements, such as replacing invalid characters or truncating the name if it exceeds the maximum length. If the Agent ID is a MAC address, colon characters (`:`) will be replaced with dashes (`-`) to ensure the name is valid.

## How to enable Auto Enrollment

There is a CLI flag and an environment variable.

- **CLI flag**: `--tink-server-auto-enrollment-enabled=true`
- **Environment variable**: `TINKERBELL_TINK_SERVER_AUTO_ENROLLMENT_ENABLED=true`

In the Helm chart, use the following configuration in the `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
deployment:
  envs:
    tinkServer:
      autoEnrollmentEnabled: true
```

or set the Helm value from the CLI:

```bash
--set "deployment.envs.tinkServer.autoEnrollmentEnabled=true"
```

## How to configure a `ruleset.workflow.tinkerbell.org`

RuleSets are Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). Here is an example RuleSet.

```yaml
apiVersion: workflow.tinkerbell.org/v1alpha1
kind: RuleSet
metadata:
  name: ruleset1
  namespace: tink-system
spec:
  rules:
  - '{"networkInterfaces": {"mac": [{"wildcard": "*"}]}}'
  workflow:
    addAttributes: true
    disabled: false
    namespace: tink-system
    template:
      agentValue: worker_id
      kvs:
        additional_value: im a value
      ref: sleep
```

### RuleSet fields

- **rules [array]**: Rules is a list of Quamina patterns used to match against the attributes of an Agent. See [https://github.com/timbray/quamina/blob/main/PATTERNS.md](https://github.com/timbray/quamina/blob/main/PATTERNS.md) for more information on the required format. All rules are combined using the `OR` operator. If any rule matches, the corresponding Workflow will be created.
- **workflow [object]**: Workflow holds the data used to configure the created Workflow.
  - **addAttributes [boolean]**: This indicates if the Agent attributes should be added as an Annotation in the created Workflow.
  - **disabled [boolean]**: Disabled indicates whether the Workflow will be enabled or not when created.
  - **namespace [string]**: The namespace to use when creating the Workflow.
  - **template [object]**: Data related to the configuration of the Template used in the created Workflow.
    - **agentValue [string]**: A value used in the referenced Template for the `Task[].worker` value. For example: "`device_id`" or "`worker_id`".
    - **kvs [map]**: Key-value pairs usable in the referenced Template.
    - **ref [string]**: The name of a Template object used in the created Workflow.

## How to discover Agent attributes

When starting out, it is recommended to create a RuleSet that matches all Agents and disables running of a Workflow. This will create a disabled Workflow for each Agent that connects to Tink server. The Workflow will contain the Agent's attributes as an Annotation (`tinkerbell.org/agent-attributes`), which can be inspected to determine the Agent's characteristics for use in creating more specific rules. Attributes can be inspected using the following command:

```bash
kubectl get wf -n <namespace> enrollment-<agent id> -o jsonpath='{.metadata.annotations.tinkerbell\.org/agent-attributes}' | jq
```

Once familiar with the attributes, you can create more specific RuleSets to match your environment.

> [!NOTE]  
> A disabled Workflow can be enabled using the following command:  
> `kubectl patch wf -n <namespace> enrollment-<agent id> -p '{"spec":{"disabled":false}}' --type merge`

### Example of Agent attributes

The following is an example of the attributes data structure and data types of an Agent. See also the [Go struct definition](../../pkg/data/attributes.go).

## Workflow Creation

When a matching RuleSet is found, a Workflow is created with the following:

1. The name is prefixed by `enrollment-`.
1. The owner reference is set to the matching RuleSet.
1. If enabled adds Agent attributes as an annotation.

Given this example RuleSet:

```yaml
apiVersion: workflow.tinkerbell.org/v1alpha1
kind: RuleSet
metadata:
  name: ruleset1
  namespace: tink-system
spec:
  rules:
  - '{"networkInterfaces": {"mac": [{"wildcard": "*"}]}}'
  workflow:
    addAttributes: true
    disabled: false
    namespace: tink-system
    template:
      agentValue: worker_id
      kvs:
        additional_value: im a value
      ref: example
```

The following Workflow will be created for any Agent:

```yaml
apiVersion: tinkerbell.org/v1alpha1
kind: Workflow
metadata:
  name: enrollment-hello123456
  namespace: tink-system
  ownerReferences:
  - apiVersion: workflow.tinkerbell.org/v1alpha1
    kind: RuleSet
    name: ruleset1
    uid: a8a6e8a7-6a8c-4fee-bcba-2318e4b7ae5b
  resourceVersion: "374571"
  uid: f81d3e11-d9c7-46bd-aa0b-fbfa16c90ca4
spec:
  disabled: false
  hardwareMap:
    additional_value: im a value
    worker_id: hello123456
  templateRef: example
```

## Troubleshooting

Common issues:

1. **No matching RuleSet found**
   - Verify the agent attributes match at least one rule
   - Check rules syntax for errors
   - Enable debug logging on the server

2. **Workflow creation fails**
   - Check permissions for creating workflows in the target namespace
   - Verify the template referenced in the rule set exists

3. **Workflow not running**
   - Check that the workflow controller is running
   - Verify the workflow is not disabled
   - Check the template is valid

Useful commands:

```bash
# List RuleSets
kubectl get rulesets.workflow

# Describe a RuleSet
kubectl describe ruleset.workflow <name>

# Check server logs
kubectl logs -l app=tinkerbell
```
